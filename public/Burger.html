<h1> How to layer a burger?</h1>

1. Start from the bottom with a lightly toasted bun <br/>
 
2. Add at least a teaspoon of your chosen sauce <br/>
 
3. Lettuce next, use a whole leaf to catch any patty juices <br/>
 
4. Thick slices of tomato <br/>
 
5. The star, your patty with melted cheese <br/>
 
6. Pickles and onions settle nicely on that melted cheese <br/>
 
7. Top it off the the other half of the bun slathered with sauce <br/>
<h2>The best buns for burgers</h2>

<h6><mark>Not all buns are created equal.</mark></h6> <em>Too soft and it will fall apart, too hard and your fillings will end up on the table. 
 
Soft patties made with mince or veggies work better with soft buns. Try the classic seeded buns, brioche, milk buns or potato buns. A steak or chicken burger is less delicate, so it can work well with denser bread such as ciabatta buns. Going low-carb? Why not try a burger with a mushroom bun or follow this guide to low-carb burgers.
 
Toast the cut side of your bun under a grill or in a hot, dry pan. This adds crunch and also helps keep the bun from going soggy with sauces and juices. If you like a crunchier burger, toast both sides. Avoid over-toasting as this can make the bun too dry and hard.</em>
 
<h2>Classic burger sauce ideas:</h2>
<em>Sauces are essential.</em> <br/>
<h5> keep your burger from being dry, and provide sharpness, tanginess, sweetness or creaminess to your burger, helping to cut through all the richness.
 
You can buy burger sauces or make them yourself. Apart from your standard tomato or BBQ sauce, try these sauce combos in your next burger:</h5>
 
1. Classic burger sauce: mix equal parts tomato sauce, mayo and mild mustard plus pickle brine to taste. <br/>
 
2. Spicy burger sauce: mix tomato sauce with chutney, mustard and hot sauce. <br/>
 
3. Asian-style sauces: Thai sweet chilli, Sriracha mayo, wasabi mayo or gochujang.<br/>
 
4. Ideal for fish and chicken burgers: mix mayonnaise with your choice of chopped herbs, capers, pickles, chipotle chilli and lemon juice.<br/>
 
5. Healthier ideas: pesto, hummus, healthy BBQ sauce, tzatziki.<br/>
 
<h4>Remember to sauce both sides of the bun, and be generous. Use at least a teaspoon on each side. Mix and match sauces on the top and bottom to add more flavours to your burger.</h4>
 
<h2>What type of lettuce is best for burgers?</h2>
Putting lettuce in a burger isn’t for “veggie smuggling”, it’s adds texture and freshness. Plus, placing lettuce under the patty helps to keep the bun from getting soggy.
 
Iceberg and cos lettuce leaves are great varieties to provide crunch without competing flavours. They’re particularly good for beef or lamb burgers. For softer patties such as fish or veggie, consider using soft leaf varieties such as butter lettuce, red oak leaf or even rocket. Use whole leaves rather than shredded lettuce for optimal crunch and to avoid wilting.</br>
 
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> For a photo-worthy burg, let the lettuce spill over the bun for colour.</p>
